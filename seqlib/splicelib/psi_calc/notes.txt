SO, PSI prior beta(1, 1) -> posterior beta( 1 + # inclusion reads, 1 + # exclusion reads)

but, how to use this? what is my p value of two different distributions? what is my bayes factor?

      probability of model | data  = P(M|D) = P(D|M)P(M)
                                              ---------
                                                Pr(D)

      P(D|M1)    ∫P(Θ1|M1)P(D|Θ1,M1)dΘ1
BF =  -------  = ---------------------- 
      P(D|M2)    ∫P(Θ2|M2)P(D|Θ2,M2)dΘ2


now, if instead of integral you use Maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter for each model, is a maximum likelihood test. 

ok....

what does Peter do...

well, you could do a binomial test or a chi squared test to see if the reads supporting events are different

OR, you can say that the reads are coming from a binomial... and say, psi distribution is a beta distribution on 0-1

so, cond 1 B(1+j1_reads,1+j2_reads) where j1_reads is n reads supporting junction 1

then you can get B in condition 2, and take the convolution of the two beta distriutions (the negative of one) to get the distribution of delta-psis

you can get a BF from this, or compute 90 Bayesian window something or oether...
